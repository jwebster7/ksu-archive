Relation:
	Route{ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location, Bus}

Functional Dependencies:
	{DepartureTime, Location} -> {Bus}
	{ArrivalTime} -> {DepartureTime}
	{Bus, ArrivalTime} -> {Location}

-- Question 1 --
20 points - Compute the closure of all sets of attributes.

	- {ArrivalTime}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime}
	- {DepartureTime}+ ={DepartureTime}
	- {Location}+ = {Location}
	- {Bus}+ ={Bus}
	
	- {ArrivalTime, DepartureTime}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime}
	- {ArrivalTime, Location}+ ={ArrivalTime, Location, DepartureTime, Bus}
	- {ArrivalTime, Bus}+ ={ArrivalTime, Bus, DepartureTime, Location}
	- {Bus, Location}+ ={Bus, Location}
	- {Bus, DepartureTime}+ ={Bus, DepartureTime}
	- {DepartureTime, Location}+ ={DepartureTime, Location, Bus}
	
	- {ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location, Bus}
	- {ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Bus}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Bus, Location}
	- {ArrivalTime, Location, Bus}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location, Bus}
	- {DepartureTime, Location, Bus}+ ={DepartureTime, Location, Bus}
	
	- {ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location, Bus}+ ={ArrivalTime, DepartureTime, Location, Bus}

	
-- Question 2 --
5 points - Using the closures from Question 1, identify the keys for the relation Route. 
Remember we want minimal keys, not just any superkey.

	- {ArrivalTime, Location}
	- {ArrivalTime, Bus}

	
-- Question 3 -- 
10 points - Using the closures from Question 1, list all non-trivial functional 
dependencies for the relation Route.

	- {ArrivalTime} -> {DepartureTime}
	- {ArrivalTime, Bus} -> {Location, DepartureTime}
	- {ArrivalTime, Location} -> {DepartureTime, Bus}
	- {ArrivalTime, Location, Bus} -> {DepartureTime}
	- {DepartureTime, Location} -> {Bus}
	- {DepartureTime, Location, ArrivalTime} -> {Bus}
	- {DepartureTime, ArrivalTime, Bus} -> {Location}

Relation:
	Shuttle{DepartureTime, Route, Driver, Bus, Capacity}

Functional Dependencies:
	{Bus, DepartureTime} -> {Driver}
	{Bus} -> {Capacity}
	{Route, DepartureTime} -> {Bus}
	
-- Question 4 --
	5 points - For each of the three provided functional dependencies above, X → Y, 
compute X+. Once you have the closures computed, identify the key(s) for the relation Shuttle.

	- {Bus, DepartureTime}+ ={Bus, DepartureTime, Driver, Capacity}
	- {Bus}+ ={Bus, Capacity}
	- {Route, DepartureTime}+ ={Route, DepartureTime, Bus, Capacity, DepartureTime}
	
	- The only key is {Route, DepartureTime}
	
-- Question 5 --
	10 points - From Question 4, we can see that Bus → Capacity is a violation of Boyce-Codd 
Normal Form (BCNF). Decompose the relation Shuttle into BCNF relations, starting with this 
dependency violation.

Show each iteration in your work, and make clear which relations are your resulting BCNF relations.
Identify the key in each of the resulting BCNF relations.

	- superkey: {Route, DepartureTime} -> {DepartureTime, Route, Driver, Bus, Capacity}
	- FD 1: {Bus, DepartureTime}+ = {Bus, DepartureTime, Driver, Capacity}
	
	- Relation: Shuttle {DepartureTime, Route, Driver, Bus, Capacity}
	- X+ = {Bus, Capacity} where B is the Key
	- R1 = {Bus, DepartureTime, Driver, Route} = {X UNION (ALL - X+)}
	- X2+ = {Bus, DepartureTime, Driver}
	- R2 = {Bus, Route}
